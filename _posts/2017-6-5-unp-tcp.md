## general

* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) reliable byte-stream protocol
* UDP (User Datagram Protocol) unreliable datagram protocol
* SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) reliable transport protocol
* IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) used with multicasting
* ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) routers and hosts
* ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps IPv4 address into a hardware address
* RARP (Reserve Address Resolution Protocol) maps hardware address to IPv4 address
* BPF (BSD packet filter)
* DLPI (Datalink provider interface)
* IPv4/IPv6 host == dual-stack host

## tools
* tcpdump
* traceroute
* ping

## UDP

* msg --> UDP socket --> UDP datagram --> IP datagram --> dest
* no gurantee reach dest
* no gurantee order
* no gurantee reach only once
* msg have length whereas TCP msg is stream
* connectionless

## TCP
* connection
* reliability (reliable delivery of data or reliable notification of failure)
* RTT (round-trip time)
* sequence the data with number
* flow control: advertised window
* full-duplex

## SCTP
* provides association between clients and servers
* reliability
* sequenceing
* flow control
* full-deplex
* message-oriented
* multihoming


## TCP connect, accept, close
### Three-way handshake
1. server bind and listen
2. client send SYN with an IP header, a TCP header and TCP options
3. server send ACK + SYN to client in one segment
4. client acknowledge the server's SYN
